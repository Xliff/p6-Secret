- secret_attribute_build() uses C's variable argument structure to create
  a GHashTable. Since creating GHashTable's are still problematic, a
  helper library must be created that will use secret_attribute_build().

  To do this, the helper shall be able to take an array of up to 16 pairs.
  The call to secret_attribute_build must account for ALL POSSIBLE CALLS
  PATTERS. This means that there shall be 16 CALLS TO secret_attribute_build,
  depending on the length of the array.

  Sucks. I know -- blame the people who created, and didn't update, the
  various va_arg specs.
